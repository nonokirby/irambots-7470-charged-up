/**
 * This is a demo program showing the use of the navX MXP to implement
 * a "rotate to angle" feature.
 *
 * This example will automatically rotate the robot to one of four
 * angles (0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees).
 *
 * This rotation can occur when the robot is still, but can also occur
 * when the robot is driving.  When using field-oriented control, this
 * will cause the robot to drive in a straight line, in whathever direction
 * is selected.
 *
 * This example also includes a feature allowing the driver to "reset"
 * the "yaw" angle.  When the reset occurs, the new gyro angle will be
 * 0 degrees.  This can be useful in cases when the gyro drifts, which
 * doesn't typically happen during a FRC match, but can occur during
 * long practice sessions.
 *
 * Note that the PID Controller coefficients defined below will need to
 * be tuned for your drive system.
